# GhostLock 5.10

This is a kernel root exploit for the Amazon Fire Max 11 (`sunstone`) and the Fire TV Stick 4K 2nd Gen / 2023 (`karat`), adapted from CVE-2026-43499 in [CyberMeowfia](https://github.com/NebuSec/CyberMeowfia).

## Building

Requires GNU Make and Android NDK r29.

```sh
make                 # Fire Max 11 (sunstone), the default
make PROJECT=karat   # Fire TV Stick 4K 2nd Gen
```

Or build a distributable zip, which handles everything for you:

```sh
./makedist.sh                 # sunstone
PROJECT=karat ./makedist.sh   # karat
```

The result is written to `dist/ghostlock-<date>.zip`.

## Usage

```sh
./root.sh
```

On Windows, run `root.bat`.

The script reboots the device, runs the exploit, and drops you into a root shell when it finishes. If it fails, it will automatically retry up to 8 times.

If successful, you will see a root shell prompt like this:

```
root@sunstone:/ #
```

On newer versions of Fire OS, Amazon added KASLR, so it might take a few minutes to fully run. Be patient. Once it is up, `su` works from any `adb shell` until the next reboot.

There is also a bind shell on `127.0.0.1:9999`, kept open for as long as root lasts. The easiest way in is to run `nc` on the device itself:

```sh
adb shell -t "nc 127.0.0.1 9999"
```

Or forward the port and connect from the host:

```sh
adb forward tcp:9999 tcp:9999
stty raw -echo; nc 127.0.0.1 9999; stty sane
```

> [!CAUTION]
> While you are root, our device still uses dm-verity, so any modification to the system/vendor/etc. partitions will result in a brick. Damaging critical partitions such as LK, TEE, or Preloader will also result in a brick. Use this exploit at your own risk.

## OTAs

OTA updates are disabled automatically as soon as root succeeds. A single OTA can move you to a build that is not supported here, or that fixes the exploit.

The exact packages differ between the tablet and the Fire TV Stick, the exploit picks the right set based on the device. Look for `OTA: pm ... ok` lines in the output to confirm.

If any step reports `not applied`, run it yourself from the root shell.

On the Fire Max 11 (`sunstone`):

```sh
pm disable com.amazon.device.software.ota
pm disable com.amazon.kindle.otter.oobe.forced.ota
sync
```

On the Fire TV Stick (`karat`):

```sh
pm disable com.amazon.device.software.ota
pm clear com.amazon.device.software.ota
pm disable com.amazon.device.software.ota.override
pm disable-user com.amazon.sneakpeek
pm disable com.amazon.client.metrics
sync
```

This survives reboots but not a factory reset. To re-enable, `pm enable` (or `pm enable-user`) the same packages from a root shell.
